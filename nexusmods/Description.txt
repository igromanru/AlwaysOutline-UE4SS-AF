[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The mod enables Outlines for other Players, to be able to find them better.
Currently, I know only of 3 possible outline colors that can be used. [color=#f4f4f4][b]White[/b][/color] (very light outline), [color=#00ffff][b]Blue[/b][/color] (Cyan, used for objects highlighting) and [color=#ff0000][b]Red[/b][/color] (used for NPC highlighting, when wearing certain armor set).
Currently, the mod only applies the color (default [b]White[/b]), which can be set in [b]main.lua[/b] via a variable, to other players. I might add Outlines to NPCs, Enemies or special objects if there is enough interest for it.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=1]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Follow the instruction on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]UE4SS for Abiotic Factor[/url] page to download and install latest UE4SS from there.
2. After use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab of this mod to download the mod as a zip file.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]AlwaysOutline[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\AlwaysOutline\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\AlwaysOutline\[/i][/size]
5. Verify that you have installed the mod correctly.
The mod directory should contain a [b]Scripts[/b] folder and an [b]enabled.txt[/b] file.
[size=2][i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\AlwaysOutline\Scripts\[/i]
[i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\AlwaysOutline\enabled.txt[/i][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]All the configurations are happening in the [b]main.lua[/b][/size]
1. Navigate into mod's directory->Scripts to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be under: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\AlwaysOutline\Scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. Under the [b]Configurations[/b] section in the [i]main.lua[/i] you will find variables that you can change.
Currently, you can only change the [b]PlayerOutlineColor[/b] variable to modify in which color other players should be outlined.
Assign one of the predefined color variables to it. (Blue, White or Red)
Example:
[code]---------- Configurations ----------
PlayerOutlineColor = Blue
------------------------------------
[/code]
4. Don't forget to save the file!
